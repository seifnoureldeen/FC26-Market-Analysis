## 📌 Executive Summary
This project analyzes the EA Sports FC 26 transfer market to identify inefficiencies and "undervalued" players. By analyzing over 18,000 player items, I developed a "Value Score" algorithm to help users maximize their budget.

## 🔍 Key Findings
1.  **The Premier League Tax:** Players in the Premier League cost ~40% more than statistically identical players in Serie A or La Liga.
2.  **Positional Bias:** The market overvalues "Pace" and Strikers, while Goalkeepers and Defensive Midfielders offer the highest ROI (Return on Investment).
3.  **The "Hidden Gem" Algorithm:** Using SQL, I identified the Top 20 players who offer Elite-tier stats (>85) for budget prices (<5,000 coins).

## 🛠️ Technical Steps
- **Data Cleaning (SQL):** Removed 109 invalid rows (Free Agents/Nulls) to ensure data integrity.
- **Analysis (SQL):** Calculated `Cost Per Point` and `Value Score` metrics using aggregate functions.
- **Visualization (Tableau):** Built an interactive dashboard with Action Filters to allow dynamic player profiling.
